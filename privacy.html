            </div>

            <div class="legal-content">
                <p>Four Pi Systems LLC ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Stooly mobile application ("Stooly" or the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use Stooly.</p>

                <p>We built Stooly with privacy as a core principle. We believe you should understand exactly what happens to your data, and we've designed the App to collect only the minimum information necessary to provide you with a great experience.</p>

                <div class="legal-highlight">
                    <p><strong>The key thing to know:</strong> Photos you take in Stooly are used solely for real-time analysis and are never stored. Only the resulting health data (classification, scores, and metrics) is saved to your account.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

                <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
                <p>When you create an account using Sign in with Apple, we receive:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A unique user identifier provided by Apple</li>
                    <li>Your email address (or Apple's private relay email, if you choose to hide your email)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not receive or store your Apple ID password, and we do not collect your name unless you choose to provide it.</p>

                <h3>1.2 Photos and Camera Access</h3>
                <p>Stooly requests access to your device's camera to capture photos for analysis. Here is exactly what happens to your photos:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You take a photo within the App.</li>
                    <li>The photo is transmitted securely to our servers via an encrypted connection (HTTPS).</li>
                    <li>The photo is sent to a third-party AI processing service for analysis. The AI service processes the image in real-time and returns classification results.</li>
                    <li>The photo is immediately discarded after analysis. It is never written to disk, stored in a database, or retained in any form on our servers or by the AI service.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>We never store, save, view, or share your photos. Period.</strong></p>

                <h3>1.3 Health and Wellness Data</h3>
                <p>After AI analysis, the following health-related data points are generated and stored in your account:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bristol Scale classification</strong> (stool type 1&ndash;7)</li>
                    <li><strong>Color analysis</strong> (e.g., brown, dark brown, yellow)</li>
                    <li><strong>Form and consistency</strong> descriptors</li>
                    <li><strong>Anomaly flags</strong> (e.g., presence of blood, mucus, or other notable characteristics)</li>
                    <li><strong>AI confidence score</strong> for the classification</li>
                    <li><strong>Gut Health Score</strong> (0&ndash;100, calculated from your entries over time)</li>
                    <li><strong>Trend data</strong> (aggregated patterns over 30-day periods)</li>
                    <li><strong>Timestamps</strong> of each entry</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This data is used to provide you with health insights, track trends, and generate personalized wellness tips within the App.</p>

                <h3>1.4 Subscription and Purchase Data</h3>
                <p>If you subscribe to Stooly, your purchase is processed through Apple's App Store. We use RevenueCat, a third-party subscription management service, to validate your purchase receipt and manage your subscription status. We do not receive or store your payment information (credit card number, billing address, etc.) — this is handled entirely by Apple.</p>

                <h3>1.5 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We do not collect your precise location</li>
                    <li>We do not collect your contacts or address book</li>
                    <li>We do not collect browsing history</li>
                    <li>We do not use advertising identifiers</li>
                    <li>We do not use tracking pixels or third-party analytics that identify you personally</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
                <table>
